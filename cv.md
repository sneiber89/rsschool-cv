I want to learn how to program and if possible go to work remotely. My first education is a computer repairman. Next I studied at the correspondence department of the Baranovichi University as an engineer - programmer, and graduated from the university in 2016. From 2010 to 2020 I worked in the electronics repair industry. I am currently working as a driver. I am familiar with programming languages C++, VB, Delphi, Html - but I have no experience.

### The first task with Codewars

```
int multiply(int a, int b)
{
    return a * b;
}
```
